Zenoh API Reference
*******************



[Zenoh](https://zenoh.io) /zeno/ is a stack that unifies data in motion, data at
rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed
storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency
that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Before delving into the examples, we need to introduce few **Zenoh** concepts.
First off, in Zenoh you will deal with **Resources**, where a resource is made up of a
key and a value.  The other concept you'll have to familiarize yourself with are
**key expressions**, such as ``robot/sensor/temp``, ``robot/sensor/*``, ``robot/**``, etc.
As you can gather, the above key expression denotes set of keys, while the ``*`` and ``**``
are wildcards representing respectively (1) a single chunk (non-empty sequence of characters that doesn't contain ``/``), and (2) any amount of chunks (including 0).

Below are some examples that highlight these key concepts and show how easy it is to get
started with.

Quick start examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Publish a key/value pair onto Zenoh
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

>>> import zenoh
>>> with zenoh.open() as z:
>>>     z.put('demo/example/hello', 'Hello World!')

Subscribe to a set of keys with Zenoh
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

>>> import zenoh, time
>>> def listener(sample):
>>>     print(f"{sample.key_expr} => {sample.payload.decode('utf-8')}")
>>>
>>> with zenoh.open() as z:
>>>     with z.subscribe('demo/example/**', listener) as subscriber:
>>>         time.sleep(60)

Get keys/values from zenoh
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

>>> import zenoh
>>> with zenoh.open() as z:
>>>     for response in z.get('demo/example/**'):
>>>         response = response.ok
>>>         print(f"{response.key_expr} => {response.payload.deserialize(str)}")
